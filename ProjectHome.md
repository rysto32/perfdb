perfdb, the Performance Dashboard, is a configurable pmc-based ncurses application that is used for monitoring the performance of a running FreeBSD system.  perfdb calculates performance metrics like Cycles per Instruction(CPI) or branch misprediction rate from counters provided by hwpmc(8).  The metrics are defined in a simple text format which makes it easy to define new metrics applicable to your application.
